# Milestone 4 Reflection


### Accomplishments of dashboard deliverables

- Both our DashPy and DashR dashboards display 3 intuitive and interactive illustrations, including a scatter plot, bar chart and line chart. The dashboard layout is clear and easy to comprehend, while the graphs are approriately selected for the data. Moreover,the filter and interactive components on the graphs are effective and efficient for users to explore the data. Users can filter the overall popularity range and music genre which impact all three illustrations, as well as the individual components in the line chart and scartterplot. Consequently, users can easily use this dashboard to acquire the knowledge they need depending on their interests.
- In terms of the deliverable of the dashboard, there is no difference in our DashPy and DashR. In DashPy and DashR, the user experience remains consistent as well. The 3 graphs are not only distinctive in its functional purpose, but also are interconnected to each other through interactive components. 
- Based on the peer review feedback, the dashboard layout design is aesthetically pleasing but also simple and clear. The usage instructions and title of each graph is also straightforward.

### Differences between DashPy and DashR

- Although we used different coding language in creating DashPy and DashR app, we were able to deliver the same visualization and functionality across. Both app have a user-friendly interface and are both launched on Heroku, which is convenient to access.

### Improvements based on feedback

- Based on the feedback we received, we added the pickle file and dcc loading page in order to improve the loading speed of our dashboard and the overall user experience. We have also tried to implement data server, but we struggled to make it work with the docker we have added. 
- We updated and modified the stle in the about section to improve the layout of the dashboard. Additionally, based on the peer review feedback, we added a picture background to our dashboard and adjusted the font, which significantly improves the aesthetic feature of our dashboard.
- Based on the feedback, we have also added a guide instruction in our dashboard to make it more user friendly especially for users that lack experience in data analysis. 

### Limitations and future improvements

- In one of the peer review comments that we received, they have suggested that we could add a tab feature to improve navigation of the dashboard. We are yet to resolve this suggestion because currently if we add the tab feature, each tab would make the graphs disproportionally large and hard to interact with. In the future, as we add more graphs and interactive components, the tab feature can then be better implemented.
- We sometimes experience connection issues with Heroku, which we have checked with the professor. It appears that sometimes when connection with Heroku is off, we are not able to open our app via website link. We have yet to solve the glitch with further discussion with the professor. 
- For future development, we will aim to add some more illustrations and features that enable users to explore more components of music and the relationship between components and popularity. Ideally, some of these additional features will be more advanced graphs. 
- Another important future development is to add more filtering options and interactive components so that users can better customize and locate the specific piece of information they need. By adding the interactive components, the different graphs can have even more interconnectedness so that the dashboard can provide more useful insights to the users.
